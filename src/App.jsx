          I'm not very comfortable writing in Hindi or Marathi, so I'm trying to
          write in English with a bit of Hindi.
          <br />
          I can write a whole book about it, but I'll try to keep it short.
          <br />I never imagined I would have to write this, but it's our last
          hope.
          <br />
          Please read this not as Ankita's older brother, but as best friend of
          me & Ankita.
          <br />I too have a sister so I know that as Ankita's brother, you
          might not like it at first, but we're in the 21st century, so please
          read with an open mind.
          <br />I hope you can understand from my and Ankita's perspective.

        You already know Ankita and I were classmates in 11th and 12th. But I
        think this is the time, there's much more you should know.
        <br /> I'm not sure if I'll ever have the courage to send you this
        message, but if I do, know that I'm deeply in love and in fear of
        losing, and I can't handle it anymore.
        <br />
        <br /> So, the story goes back to our college days. I liked Ankita then
        (as her brother, this might not sound good to you, but I hope you
        understand). But I was always focused on studies and never talked to her
        about it. Later in the story, I found out she felt the same but couldn't
        tell me due to anxiety and shyness. After that, we lost touch. I
        excelled in my studies and got into engineering in Pune. I sincerely
        pursued my studies, and after multiple job offers, I joined Persistent
        Systems as a Software Engineer in August 2020. As I started using social
        media, I reconnected with Ankita. We started talking again, shared
        numbers, and I even started using Snapchat because of her. We've been
        talking day and night for over 1.5+ years now everywhere on calls,
        whatsapp, insta, telegram, sms. We know everything about each other's
        lives, including each others families. I know everything about your
        family members <br />

        Bhiyya's Birthdate - 19th March <br />
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">Ankita -</span> I can never finish writing
        how much I know about her & how much I understand her. She has told me
        everything about herself. What all thing she did after 12th. The
        Engineering, her intrests hobbies, And also about Aman. How he came &
        destroyed her life. How you guys went to his family marrige. and many
        thing which none of us would like to talk about. After the breakup how
        she felt and how everyone treated her. Every small thing. But forget the
        sad part. <br />
        Her tries for the government pwd exam few months back. her Salesforce
        course in pune. Not only this, But all her dresses, all her heels &
        chappals, make up items, & all her favourite things, She has sent me soo
        many pictures of her that I have more pics of her than my own in my
        phone gallary now ðŸ˜„ <br />
        She taught me what soulmate is - She told me how she and I are
        soulmates, and how she regrets why she didn't found me before, Aman.
        <br />
        During all this time we spend - we have seen many good and bad things
        togather - we fought with each other multiple times and always came back
        - cared and loved each other But we never met. We have maintained
        boundries till now. We have talked for hours on calls, messages, Also
        face to face we have talked is many times with she in your gallry and I
        standing in front of her in the hanuman ji's temple. Also one time I
        surprised her with a gift box directly in front of your house. She was
        shy and nervous. These are our only face to face encounters and we have
        never met outside anywhere till now. And neither of us have forced
        anything on each other ever. <br />
        <br />
        So many things happened, and recently, things got serious. That's why I
        tried to meet you at the wedding. All I wanted was to build a friendship
        with you, but I didn't get much response. Mumma already know everything
        about me - As she and my bua were classmates. I have introduced Ankita
        to few of my family members. She knows my chachi very well now and she
        talks with her frequently on calls & messages. They have discussed about
        our marrige and how we will face blockers and how we have to convince
        everyone. She said that mummy will understand and and she is just scared
        of papa and you. She was also concerned that because of her past and
        Nani's incident, you guys won't allow her or listen to her anymore. She
        is also scared that because of her past or your two experiences with
        girls even you won't support her as friend & brother. <br />
        <br />
        She has the past trauma from which she is not healed completely and
        scared of her own family. But still, for love she tried to talk to mummy
        multiple times. Mummy's reaction was quite obvious and firstly she
        talked about the cast issues, then gave examples of failed marriges,
        they have talked for hours and mummy demotived Ankita & told her that if
        she told it to papa you guys will get her married in 2 months with
        anyone. So basically she is in very bad situation where she has to think
        about samaj, family pressure, and us. <br />
        And she doesn't wanna make you guys feel bad. So she will get ready to
        get married to whoever unknown guy you guys will get for her. <br />
        She is basically killing herself & her emotions due to past & due to
        fear of her own family. <br />
        But I think there is only one in your family who is educated and mature
        enough to understand us and it is You Bhaiyya. <br />I know you might
        feel mixed emotions while reading thisâ€”anger, care, shockâ€”but please try
        to understand & digest everything with calm.
        <br />
        She is your sister after all and you love her and you want the best for
        her. <br />
        Your parents will marry Ankita off to a stranger guy in a year whose
        past & future you will have no clue about and whose only plus point will
        be he is of same cast, and even Ankita will get ready to sacrifice her
        happiness for your family's sake.
        <br />
        <br />
        Me and Ankita understand each other so well. We have spent so much time
        togather, made the future plans togather, So in love that I can not
        imagine my future without her. And day by day my fear of losing her is
        increasing. I am feeling anxious, depressed & mentally stressed because
        I can not imagine my life without her. All I've told you is just a glass
        of water from the ocean and there is so much more about our story.
        <br />
        But the point is I wanna marry Ankita, take care of her & worship her
        for lifetime. <br />
        We are living in 21st century where it's very hard to find people who
        care, love, who earn good & have good families. And I have all of it
        except one thing that is same cast. It's shouldn't matter in today's age
        but I've heard your family is quite orthodox. So I even tried finding
        out the process to change my cast. <br />
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">
          Also FYI Let me introduce myself. I am Aadesh Nirfarake, I have a home
          in maliwada (I know it might not sound good because of the rowdy
