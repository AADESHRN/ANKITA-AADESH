      <p>
      I'm not very comfortable writing in Hindi or Marathi, so I'm trying to write in English with a bit of Hindi.
I can write a write a whole book about it about this, but I'll try to keep it short.
I never imagined I would have to write this, but it's our last hope.
Please read this not as Ankita's older brother, but as best friend of me & Ankita. 
I too have a sister so I know that as Ankita's brother, you might not like it at first, but we're in the 21st century, so please read with an open mind. 
I hope you can understand from my and Ankita's perspective. 
Writing this with a heavy heart at 2 in the night.

You already know Ankita and I were classmates in 11th and 12th. But I think this is the time, there's much more you should know. 
I'm not sure if I'll ever have the courage to send you this message, but if I do, know that I'm deeply in love and in fear of losing, and I can't handle it.

So, the story goes back to our college days. I liked Ankita then (as her brother, this might not sound good to you, but I hope you understand). 
But I was always focused on studies and never talked to her about it. 
Later in the story, I found out she felt the same but couldn't tell me due to anxiety and shyness.

After that, we lost touch. I excelled in my studies and got into engineering in Pune. 
I sincerely pursued my studies, and after multiple job offers, I joined Persistent Systems as a Software Engineer in August 2020. 
As I started using social media, I reconnected with Ankita. We started talking again, shared numbers, and I even started using Snapchat because of her.

We've been talking day and night for over 1.5 years now. We know everything about each other's lives, including each others families. 
I know everything about your family members

Ankita - I can never finish writing how much I know about her & how much I understand her. She has told me everything about her. What all thing she did after 12th. 
The Engineering, her intrests hobbies, And also about Aman. How he came & destroyed her life. How you guys went to his family marrige. and many thing which none of us would like to talk about.
After the breakup how she felt and how everyone treated her. Every small thing.
But forget the sad part. Her tries for the government pwd exam few months back. her Salesforce course in pune.
Not only this, But all her dresses, favourite things, make up items, 
She has sent me soo many pictures of her that I have more pics of her than my own in my phone gallary now ðŸ˜„

She taught me what soulmate is - she told me how me and she are soulmates - And she regret why I didn't found her before Aman.

During all this time we spend - we have seen many good and bad things togather - 
we fought with each other multiple times and always came back - cared and loved each other
But we never met. We have maintained boundries till now. We have talked for hours on calls, messages, 
Also face to face we have talked is many times with she in your gallry and I standing in front of her in the hanuman ji's temple.
Also one time I surprised her with a gift box directly in front of your house. She was shy and nervous. These are our only face to face encounters and we have never met outside anywhere till now.
And neither of us have forced anything on each other ever.

So many things happened, and recently, things got serious. That's why I tried to meet you at the wedding. 
All I wanted was to build a friendship with you, but I didn't get much response.

Mumma already know everything about me - As she and my bua were classmates.
I have introduced Ankita to few of my family members. She knows my chachi very well now and she talks with her frequently on calls & messages.
They have discussed about our marrige and how we will face blockers and how we have to convince everyone.
She said that mummy will understand and and she is just scared of papa and you.
She was also concerned that because of her past and Nani's incident, you guys won't allow her or listen to het anymore.
She is also scared that because of her past or your two experiences with girls even you won't support her as friend & brother. 
She has the past trauma from which she is not healed completely and scared of her own family.
But still, for love she tried to talk to mummy on Thursday 4th April. 
Mummy's reaction was quite obvious and firstly she talked about the cast issues, then gave examples of failed marriges, 
they talked for 3 hours and mummy demotived Ankita & told her that if she told it to papa you guys will get her married in 2 months with anyone.
So basically she is in very bad situation where she has to think about samaj, family pressure, and us.
And she doesn't wanna make you guys feel bad. So she will get ready to get merried to whoever unknown guy you guys will get for her.
She is basically killing herself & her emotions due to past & due to fear of her own family.
But I think there is only one in your family who is educated and mature enough to understand us and it is You Bhaiyya.

I know you might feel mixed emotions while reading thisâ€”anger, care, shockâ€”but please try to understand & digest everything with calm.
She is your sister after all and you love her and you want the best for her. 
Your parents will marry Ankita off to a stranger in a year whose past & future you will have no clue about, and even she will get ready to sacrifice her happiness for your family's sake.

We have spent so much time togather, made the future plans togather, So in love that I can not imagine my future without her.
And day by day my fear of losing her is increasing. I am even getting panic attacks and feeling depressed & mentally stressed.

All I've told you is just a glass from the ocean and there is so much more. But the point is I wanna marry Ankita and take care of her for lifetime. We are living in 21st century where it's very hard to find people who care, love, who earn good & have good families. And I have all of it except one thing that is same cast. It's shouldn't matter in today's age but I've heard your family is quite orthodox. So I even tried finding out the process to change my cast. 

Also FYI
Let me introduce myself. 
I am Aadesh Nirfarake, I have a home in maliwada 
(I know it might not sound good because of the rowdy status this place has 
but I have always been an exception because Never had any chapri friends and I have always worked hard & acheived my dreams which you would get to know below)
I was schooleed in Bhausaheb Firodiya till 10th

Did my first switch in 2022 June, where I joied the citi group - one of the largest investment & corporate bank in USA
There as well within just one year I got promoted to senior role due to my performance.

I started earning a six-figure income at age of 22 and am now around 24 LPA at age 24. 
As with earnings, finantial knowledge, savings & investments are also important. 
I invest in equities(Mutual funds & stocks) and real estate(I am building a house in savedi on my fathers land) and enjoy spending on bikes and travel.
I have mutual fund portfolio of around 18 lakhs and around 4 lakhs worth of stocks till now.

In next 3-4 years I'll be getting opportunity to relocate to USA/Canada/Europe for few years because of our crossborder program of my company.

I am a diciplined guy who goes to gym 4 days a week, who have a full time job, 
who is parallely working on building businesses, who basically know and is commited towards his future goals and plans.
I have little interest in content creation so I create some content for Instagram on @lifeofaadesh

My family :

My family is supportive and successful.

My younger sister is also a Computer Engineer from PICT Pune (2023) and she has joined a company right after college with 18 LPA CTC.

I'm telling you all this to assure you that I'm a good, disciplined guy with clear goals. 
I have only loved one girl in my whole life i.e. Ankita and I can not imagine my future without her.
Most of my family already know her & like her. And they can support and love her forever like their daughter. We can provide her a peaceful home for lifetime.
