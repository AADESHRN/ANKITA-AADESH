          here, its matter of lives. So please read till end.
          <br />
          I'm not very comfortable writing in Hindi or Marathi, so I'm trying to
          write in English with a bit of Hindi.
          <br />
          I can write a whole book about it, but I'll try to keep it short. ‚ú®
          <br />I never imagined I would have to write this, but it's our last
          hope.
          <br />
          Please read this not as Ankita's older brother, but as best friend of
          me & Ankita.
          <br />I too have a sister so I know that as Ankita's brother, you
          might not like it at first, but we're in the 21st century, so please
          read with an open mind.
          <br />I hope you can understand from my and Ankita's perspective.

        <br />
        You already know Ankita and I were classmates in 11th and 12th. And you
        also got little idea about everything going on. But I think this is the
        time, there's much more you should know. üíØ
        <br /> I'm not sure if I'll ever have the courage to send you this
        message, because I respect you as a big brother. but if I do, know that
        it's really serious.ü§ûüèª
        <br />
        <br /> So, the story goes back to our college days. I liked Ankita then
        (as her brother, this might not sound good to you, but I hope you
        understand). But I was always focused on studies and never talked to her
        about it. Later in the story, I found out she felt the same but couldn't
        tell me due to anxiety and shyness. After that, we lost touch. I
        excelled in my studies and got into engineering in Pune. I sincerely
        pursued my studies, and after multiple job offers, I joined Persistent
        Systems as a Software Engineer in August 2020. As I started using social
        media, I reconnected with Ankita. We started talking again, shared
        numbers, and I even started using Snapchat because of her. We've been
        talking day and night for over 1.5+ years now everywhere on calls,
        whatsapp, insta, telegram, sms. We know everything about each other's
        lives, including each others families. I know everything about your
        family members üòä<br />

        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">Ankita -</span> I can never finish writing
        how much I know about her & how much I understand her. She has told me
        everything about herself. What all thing she did after 12th. The
        Engineering, her intrests hobbies, And also about Aman. That bad phase
        in her life. How she felt and how everyone treated her around that time.
        Every small thing. But forget the sad part. <br />
        Her tries for the government pwd exam few months back. her Salesforce
        course in pune. Not only this, But all her dresses, all her heels &
        chappals, make up items, & all her favourite things, She has sent me soo
        many pictures of herself that I have more pics of her than my own in my
        phone gallary now üòÑ <br />
        She taught me what soulmate is - She told me how she and I are
        soulmates, and how she regrets why she didn't found me before, Aman.
        <br />
        She share everything with me always like a family member. By this time I
        have already got many pics of BUA's re-wedding üòÑ
        <br />
        During all this time we spend - we have seen many good and bad things
        togather - we fought with each other multiple times and always came back
        - cared and loved each other But we never met. We have maintained
        boundries till now. We have talked for hours on calls, messages, Also
        face to face we have talked is many times with she in your gallry and I
        standing in front of her in the hanuman ji's temple. Also one time I
        surprised her with a gift box directly in front of your house. She was
        shy and nervous. These are our only face to face encounters and we have
        never met outside anywhere till now. And neither of us have forced
        anything on each other ever. <br />
        <br />
        So many things happened, and recently, things got serious. That's why I
        tried to meet you at the wedding. All I wanted was to build a friendship
        with you, but I didn't get much response from you. Mumma already know everything
        about me - She and my bua were classmates. I have introduced Ankita to
        all of my family members. She knows my chachi very well now and she
        talks with her very frequently on calls & messages. They have discussed
        about our marrige and how we will face blockers and how we have to
        convince everyone. She said that mummy will understand and and she is
        just scared of papa and you. She was also concerned that because of her
        past and Nani's incident, you guys won't allow her or listen to her
        anymore. <br />
        But after my family met papa that day, Ankita told me and I am glad to
        hear that you guys took everything positively. <br />
        <br />
        She has the past trauma from which she is not healed completely and
        scared of her own family. But still, for love she tried to talk to mummy
        multiple times. Mummy's reaction was quite obvious and firstly she
        talked about the cast issues, then gave examples of failed marriges{" "}
        <br />
        And she doesn't wanna make you guys feel bad. So she will get ready to
        get married to whoever unknown guy you guys will get for her. <br />
        She is basically killing herself & her emotions due to past & due to
        fear of her own family. <br />
        But I think there is only one in your family who is educated and mature
        enough to understand us and it is You Bhaiyya. <br />I know you might
        feel mixed emotions while reading this, but please try to understand &
        digest everything with calm.
        <br />
        She is your sister after all and you love her and you want the best for
        her. <br />
        I know mummy & papa listens to Bua ji more and they will marry Ankita
        off to a stranger guy in a year whose past & future you will have no
        clue about and whose only plus point will be he is of same cast, and
        even Ankita will get ready to sacrifice her happiness for your family's
        sake.
        <br />
        <br />
        Me and Ankita understand each other so well. We have spent so much time
        togather, made the future plans togather. If in india we always wanted
        to live in pune nearby bhiyya (You & mummy, papa) so that she/we can
        visit you/mummy/papa quite often.
        <br />I have changed myself for her. Worked hard for my last promotion
        just to increase probability to convince your family, Building one more
        new house just to make your family feel secured about us. I would do
        every possible thing in world & will keep working hard & become so big
        one day, just to fulfill all her dreams & to always keep her happy in
        life. We are so in love that I can not imagine my future without her.
        And day by day my fear of losing her is increasing. I am feeling
        anxious, depressed & stressed because I can not imagine my life without
        her. All I've told you is just a glass of water from the ocean and there
        is so much more about our story.
        <br />
        But the point is I wanna marry Ankita, take care of her, travel the
        world with her & worship her for lifetime. <br />
        We are living in 21st century where it's very hard to find people who
        care, love, who earn good & have good family. And I have all of it
        except one thing which was not in my hand that is same cast. I've heard
        your family is quite orthodox. So I even tried finding out the process
        to change my cast. Which is technically not possible ü•≤
        <br />
        'Cast, samaj, Kundali' shouldn't matter in today's age because we have
        multiple examples in world with successful marriges without matching
        cast/kundali and multiple examples of failed marriges even after
        matching all the things. <br />
        At the end all which matters is the person and his family.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold">
          By this time you might already know many things about me, As Ankita
          told me ki Bhiyya bahar se aapki info nikalne wale hai üòÑ And Ankita ne 3-4 din pehle mere awards vagaira aapko bheje hi hai üòÖ But just an
